## Running locally

Make sure you have `node` and `npm` installed on your PC. An easy test to check this:

For NodeJS
```shell
node -v
```

For NPM
```shell
npm -v
```

Now, if you haven't done this already, run `npm install` and after the packages have been installed you'll be able to start a local server. To do this run `npm start`. You should now have a local server setup to host your code.
